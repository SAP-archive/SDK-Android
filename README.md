## Specs
### Classes

This module contains 9 main classes as follows:
* Client is the client allowing you to make requests to SAP Conversational AI API.
* Response contains the response from [SAP Conversational AI](https://cai.tools.sap).
* Entity represents an entity found in you user's input as defined in [SAP Conversational AI Manual](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/#list-of-entities)
* Intent represents the intent of your user
* Action represents the actions of a conversation
* Memory represents the memory of a conversation
* MemoryEntity represents the entity inside the memory object
* Conversation allowing you to handle a conversation

### Class Client
The SAP Conversational AI Client can be instanciated with a token and provides the following methods:

#### Request:
* textRequest(String text)
* fileRequest(String filename)

These methods both return a Response object.

This method return a Conversation object.

#### Audio Recording:
* startRecording() *Starts the audio recording to a file*
* stopRecording() *Stops the audio recording, sends the audio to SAP Conversational AI and returns a Response object*

Note that all these methods should be called in separated tasks because they do http requests.


```java
import ai.sapcai.sdk_android.Client;

Client client = new Client(YOUR_TOKEN);
Response resp;

try {
  resp = client.textRequest("Hello World!");
  // Do your code...

### Class Entity
The SAP Conversational AI Entity is returned by Response and provides the following methods:
* String getName() *Returns the name of the entity*

* hex
* value
* deg
* formatted
* lng
* lat
* unit
* code
* person
* number

SAP Conversational AI entity fields types are dependant on the entity itself, so value returned must be casted depending on the entity you wait.

Refer to [SAP Conversational AI Entities Manual](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/#list-of-entities) for details about entities

```java
Response resp = client.textRequest("What's the weather in San Francisco?");
if (resp.getIntent() != null && resp.getIntent().equals("weather")) {
  Entity e = resp.getEntity("location");
  if (e != null) {
    System.out.printf("You asked me for a weather in %s\n", (String)e.getField("formated"));
  }
}
```
